# The Competitive Programming Guide

_Think algorithmically._

## The Process
* Read. The. Question. Again.
* Think
* Trace out the Algorithm on pen-paper. Remember, solve as if a human be doing it
  * Handle average cases
  * Finally, handle the edge cases
* Dry Run - normal case + edge 
* Write code
* Review code
* Run test cases
 
## Remember
* _Strength Before Weakness, Journey Before Destination._
* If a question is new: Brute force if nothing else comes to mind. Something is better than nothing. But remember, anyone can think of a brute force solution. Usually.
* Think of optimization, time complexity after brute force.
* If a questions seems familiar / I have solved before: Be extra careful, a trick condition might have been overlooked while reading the question, go a little slow.
